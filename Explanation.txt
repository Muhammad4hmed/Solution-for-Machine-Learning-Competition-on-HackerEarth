PLEASE NOTE: I have provided EDA reports in separate HTML pages and a flow chart for better understanding.




Feature Engineering:
1) I encoded categorical features using Target Mean Encoding
2) Used Pandas's interpolate to fill missing values
3) Created 900+ new features through EDA reports, please check MainNotebook to understand how I made them.
	I deep dived into EDA and used some creativity to make them.




Machine Learning:
Approach 1:
Sorted by Age and then Grouped data by Hometown and predicted separately for every hometown.

Approach 2:
Used whole data set for training and predicting.



Hyperparameter Tuning:
I did hyperparameter tuning using bayesian optimization, used optuna library.



Ensembling/Blending:
I made alot of predictions from above two approaches and combined them using following ways
1) some % from multiple predictions, eg X% of A + Y% of B + Z% of C etc
2) A + (sqaured difference of B and C)
3) (A + B) - C
4) (A + (sqaure of average of A and/or B and/or C) )

Let say some submission E is obtained from one of above.
then I used E to replace with A, B or C and repeated the above process multiple number of time.
In other words, I keep repeating above submissions with obtained one and repeated this process too many times.




Packages Used:
Sklearn, GML, Sweetviz, Autofeat, Optuna etc
